    <h1>Console: Stopped Execution</h1>

    <p>
      Let's open <a href="/examples/console/stopped-execution" target="_blank">this page.</a>
    </p>

    <p>The page is made out of two components. The top one made by "Miguel" which shows the first names, last names and full
      names of the users. And a bottom one which shows the ages made by "Jos√©".</p>

    <p>Visually, it looks like there is something wrong with the bottom component. Instead of the birth year we are getting
      undefined multiple times.</p>

    <p>
      Let's look in the console and see what's happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The first component prints the first and last names. Then it adds the full names to each person and tries to display those.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. But, there is an error when it tries to add the full name. Javascript stops the execution of everything after an error,
      unless explictly told not to do that (which isn't the case 99% of the time).
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The bottom component never gets to the point of calculating the birth year which was the final step of the page's execution.
    </p>

    <p>Who should you assign the BUG to?</p>
